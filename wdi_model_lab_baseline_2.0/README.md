# CSS Styling

## Introduction

You guys are now are now pro-efficient in making calculators, let's take the one we worked on yesterday and make it more DRY by using functions

## Exercise

#### Instructions

- With your partner, take 5 minutes to review these exercises, and make a list of things you don't understand that we still need to review to get the exercises completed, and we'll go over them.

- Define a function maxOfTwoNumbers that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them. Use the if-then-else construct available in Javascript. You'll have to remember your pre-work, or do some googling to figure this out.
- Define a function maxOfThree that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them.
- Write a function that takes a character (i.e. a string of length 1) and returns true if it is a vowel, false otherwise.
- Define a function sumArray and a function multiplyArray that sums and multiplies (respectively) all the numbers in an array of numbers. For example, sumArray([1,2,3,4]) should return 10, and multiplyArray([1,2,3,4]) should return 24.



- Write Javascript in a separate file than html
- use alert and prompt for user IO
- Do not use any validation, this will be covered in a latter lesson
